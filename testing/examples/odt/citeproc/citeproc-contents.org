    "If you have a large number of citations in your document, it's best
    to use an external bibliographic application, such as =bibtex= or
    =biber=. However, that is beyond the scope of this book.  See,
    instead, /A Guide to LaTeX/ [cite:@kopka95], /The LaTeX Companion/
    [cite:@goossens94] or [[http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/thesis/][Using LaTeX to Write a PhD Thesis]]
    [cite:@thesis]."
